Phonebook with blazor and sql database

Basically same app that was one of the exercises in fullstack course by Helsinki university.
It has some basic form validation with some regular expressions etc. Also a simple search function. 
Not the prettiest "app" but it shows some basic database functions. (CRUD)

Instead of document database it uses SQL database. It's not hosted anywhere but there is a publish script in the database solution.
